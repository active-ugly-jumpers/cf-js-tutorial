# Pokémon Web App

A study project for the CareerFoundry Full-Stack Web Development course.

## Objective
Build a small web application with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that loads data from an external API and enables viewing of Pokémon data in detail.

## Context
This project is part of the learning process to create a fully functioning JavaScript web application.  
Since building a custom API is not yet covered in the course, this app uses an external data source for Pokémon information.

The project focuses not only on JavaScript functionality but also on delivering clean, user-friendly HTML and CSS, resulting in an application that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

## Features
- Load Pokémon data from an external API
- Display a list of Pokémon with key details
- View detailed information about individual Pokémon

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Status
