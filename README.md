# Pokémon Web App

A study project for the CareerFoundry Full-Stack Web Development course.

## Objective
Build a small web application with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that loads data from an external API and enables viewing of Pokémon data in detail.

## Context
This project is part of the learning process to create a fully functioning JavaScript web application.  
Since building a custom API is not yet covered in the course, this app uses an external data source for Pokémon information.

The focus is on writing modular JavaScript, working with asynchronous data (Promises / Fetch), and applying a consistent design system with reusable CSS variables.

## Features
- Fetch and display a list of Pokémon from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
- View detailed Pokémon information (image, height, types, etc.) in a modal dialog
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Status
Work in progress as part of the CareerFoundry curriculum.
